## Overview

The Terraform Provider Secrets Hub is open source and available on GitHub.

The Terraform Provider Secrets Hub has the ability to interact with CyberArk Cloud Resources(Privilege Cloud and Secrethubs) and can create safes, accounts, secretstores and sync policies.

Note: Supported platforms for account creation are AWS, Azure, and MySQL databases.

The Terraform Provider Secrets Hub includes the following features and benefits:

Configuration in the Terraform manifest

Provider authentication to CyberArk Identity Security Platform Shared Services

A Provider can create the safe, accounts, Secretstores, sync policies in Privilege Cloud and Secrets Hub

A Terraform-sensitive flag which may be used against any secrets to keep the value from appearing in logs and on-screen.

## Authentication 

The Terraform Provider Secrets Hub authenticates to CyberArk Identity Security Platform Shared Services with the service account and its credential.

## Install the Terraform Provider Secrets Hub plugin

You can use any of the following methods to install the Terraform Provider Secrets Hub plugin:

Install using binaries (Recommended)

Compile source code

Access from the Terraform registry

Install using Homebrew (macOS only)

### Binaries (Recommended)

We recommend installing the Terraform Provider Secrets Hub plugin (terraform-provider-cybr-sh) using the appropriate binary distribution for your environment.

In the following examples, replace `$VERSION` with the latest release for your operating system from the GitHub Releases page.

Note: The following example uses a Linux binary.

1. Download the Terraform Provider Secrets Hub (darwin_amd64 or linux_amd64):

```sh
$  wget https://github.com/cyberark/terraform-provider-cybr-sh/releases/download/v$VERSION/terraform-provider-cybr-sh_$VERSION.linux_amd64.zip
```
2. Create a new subdirectory:

```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform.example.com/cyberark/cybr-sh/$VERSION/linux_amd64
```
3. Decompress the binary into the appropriate plugins directory:

```sh
$ unzip terraform-provider-cybr-sh_$VERSION_linux_amd64.zip ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform.example.com/cyberark/cybr-sh/$VERSION/linux_amd64
```
4. To uninstall or remove the previous version of the plugin, run the following command:

```sh
$ rm -rf ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform.example.com/cyberark/cybr-sh/$VERSION/linux_amd64
```

### Homebrew (MacOS)
To install the Terraform Provider Secrets Hub using Homebrew:

1. Add and update the CyberArk Tools Homebrew tap:

```sh
$ brew tap cyberark/tools
```

2. Install the Terraform Provider Secrets Hub and symlink it to Terraform's plugins directory. Symlinking is necessary because Homebrew is sandboxed and cannot write to your home directory.

   Run the following, where $VERSION is the appropriate plugin version:
_Note: Replace `$VERSION` with the appropriate plugin version_

```sh
$ brew install terraform-provider-cybr-sh

$ mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/

$ # If Homebrew is installing somewhere other than `/usr/local/Cellar`, update the path as well.

$ ln -sf /usr/local/Cellar/terraform-provider-cybr-sh/$VERSION/bin/terraform-provider-cybr-sh_* \
    ~/.terraform.d/plugins/
```
3. If you have a previously downloaded unversioned plugin, remove it:
```sh
$ brew uninstall terraform-provider-cybr-sh
$ rm -f ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform-provider-cybr-sh
```
4. Create the Terraform plugins folder if it does not already exist:
```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/
```
5. Copy the new binary to the Terraform plugins folder:
```sh
$ mv terraform-provider-cybr-sh*/terraform-provider-cybr-sh* ~/.terraform.d/plugins/
```

### Compile from Source

Before you compile the Terraform Provider Secrets Hub from the source code, make sure you have Go version 1.21 installed on your machine.

To compile the Terraform Provider Secrets Hub:

macOS/Linux

1. Clone the repository and open the cloned directory:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cyberark/terraform-provider-cybr-sh.git
$ cd terraform-provider-cybr-sh
```

2. Build the Terraform Provider Secrets Hub

```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform.example.com/cyberark/cybr-sh/$VERSION/$platform_reference_in_go
# Example: platform_reference_in_go= darwin_amd64/linux_amd64
# Note: If a static binary is required, use ./bin/build to create the executable
$ go build -o ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform.example.com/cyberark/cybr-sh/$VERSION/$platform_reference_in_go/terraform-provider-cybr-sh main.go
```



### Terraform registry

To access the Terraform Provider Secrets Hub from the Terraform registry:

In the main.tf configuration file:

- In the source, use registry.terraform.io/cyberark/cybr-sh

- In version, provide the latest version

```sh
variable "secret_key" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

terraform {
    required_providers {
      cybr-sh = {
        source  = â€œregistry.terraform.io/cyberark/cybr-sh"version = "~> 0"
      }
    }
  }

provider "cybr-sh" {
  tenant        = "aarp0000"
  domain        = "example-domain"
  client_id     = "automation@cyberark.cloud.aarp0000"
  client_secret = var.secret_key
}
resource "cybr-sh_safe" "AAM_Test_Safe" {
  safe_name          = "GEN_BY_TF_abc"
  safe_desc          = "Description for GEN_BY_TF_abc"
  member             = "demo@cyberark.cloud.aarp0000"
  member_type        = "user"
  permission_level   = "read" # full, read, approver, manager
  retention          = 7
  retention_versions = 7
  purge              = false
  cpm_name           = "PasswordManager"
  safe_loc           = ""
}
```
## Caution: Handling Sensitive Files

Important: The Terraform state file and .tfvars files contain sensitive information related to your configurations. It is essential to handle these files with the utmost care to ensure their security.

### Best Practices:

- Keep Files Private: Ensure these files are not exposed to unauthorized individuals or systems.
- Restrict Access: Limit access to these files to authorized personnel only.
- Use Encryption: Whenever possible, use encryption for both storage and transmission to protect the contents of these files.

Following these practices helps safeguard your sensitive data.

## Configure Terraform Provider Secrets Hub

This section describes how to configure the Terraform Provider Secrets Hub.

### Workflow

Terraform can be executed manually by the user. The Terraform Provider Secrets Hub reads the provider configuration and authenticates to the tenant using the service account and its credentials.

Once authenticated, it configures the resources according to the main.tf file. After setup, the resources can be viewed in Privilege Cloud and Secrets Hub.

### Use environment variables to Sensitive Parameters:

In order to use environment variables with Terraform Provider SecrestsHub use the Terraform variables and [standard mechanism]
(https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#environment-variables).

### Example

```terraform
variable "secret_key" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

provider "cybr-sh" {
  tenant        = "aarp0000"
  domain        = "example-domain"
  client_id     = "automation@cyberark.cloud.aarp0000"
  client_secret = var.secret_key
}
```

```sh
$ export TF_VAR_secret_key=my-secret-key
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
```
## Pre-requisties for Provider and Resources

- A tenant with both Privilege Cloud and Secrets Hub is required.
- Create and enable a service account and its associated secret.
- An AWS account with the SecretHub IAM role is necessary.
- Get the Privilege Cloud secret store ID via the API or user interface and insert it into the source_id section of the sync policy.

  1. UI: Log in to the CyberArk tenant with sufficient privileges to view the Privilege Cloud store details.

  2. API : Use the documentation below to make an API call and retrieve the Privilege Cloud StoreID. (https://docs.cyberark.com/secrets-hub-privilege-cloud/Latest/en/Content/Developer/sh-policy-api-tutorial.htm?tocpath=Developer%7CTutorials%7C_____4).
